model:
  backbone: timm_tf_efficientnet_b5.ns_jft_in1k # Model architecture and pre-trained weights to use
  checkpoint: swa # Checkpoint to load: "swa" for Stochastic Weight Averaging, or specify a file in the weights folder (e.g., epoch98)
  checkpoint_path: # Path to the checkpoint file (to be specified if not using default "swa")
  stage: second # Training stage: 'first' for embeddings, 'second' for classification
  num_classes: 4 # Number of output classes for classification

img_size: 384 # Image size for training and validation

return_probs: false # Whether to return the probabilities for each class
